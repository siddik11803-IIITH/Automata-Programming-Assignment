# Cellular Automata

This Assignment Shall be solved in python. We are going to have to simulate a Cellular automata, the assignment document shall be uploaded into the repo soon.

### Instructions
1. For q1, switch to the directory, run the file rule.py, with your configuration in config.txt
2. You would be prompted to enter the number of iterations. If you enter ```-1```, the program will Adios. Entering a positive value would compute the evolutions of the cellular automata, with the given configuration. 
3. This would give you the evolution of the automata, in the ```STDOUT```, and the same in ```output.txt```


### The packages, that have been used
1. colorama - for the colored rendering in ```STDOUT```.
2. OS - to clear the system
3. sleep - to hold the process of evolutions. 


Additional Codes:
The Addtional ```rule.py``` file enables one to run all the questions with variable number of iterations from a single file. The instructions are very simple and can be found if the file is run.
